			<p class = "crime_explaination">Here, we can see data for each state for the amount of reports of violent crime, the amount of reported assaulted officers, and the amount of reported homicides. The states with the highest amounts of all of these incidents are California and Texas. While that can mostly be explained by differences in population, there are still interesting findings in this data. For example, California has by far the greatest amount of homicides, beating out the next largest state, Texas, by about 700 more incidents. </p>

			<p class = "police_explaination">This graph has data on the amount of police officrs per 1000 people (or essentially police officer density), on total police officer expenditure, and on total corrections spending in general. Interestingly enough, the largest states weren't the ones the the most police expenditure even though the amount of crime seems to have scaled linearly with the data. This means that these states could possibly reduce the amount of crime they have by increasing their amount of police officers. Another interesting point, while California doesn't spend a lot of money of police officers or euipment, the are amongst the highest spenders in the country in terms of other forms of correction, such as on prisons. So California may be able to improve their situation by redistributing how it spends its money.</p>
